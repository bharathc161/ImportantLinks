Hope Everyone Is Doing Good!
I know how it feels during placement session, and what is to be done and what not, can make a momentous impact in our preparation.
And the things which will be touched on here helped my friends as well. So felt worth mentioning here.
And will also be discussing how to get a call from dream companies like Google for SDE.

There are vitally 2 things to crack any software interview, firstly to clear OT and then the interview.

***Clearing OT:(All links are provided above)

1 Above all doing questions of "Must-do gfg".(It really helps, because it encompass many standard questions which companies do ask)
2 After that solve questions "topic-wise" from gfg practise site.(Apply sort by submission)
3 Make sure your good at aptitude and english grammar.(Few companies do focus on it)
4 solve questions "topic-wise" from codeforces.

1,2 and 3 are enough to crack OT of most of the companies.
One can say we did interviewBit.(no issue its subset of 1 and 2)
4 is put up, in case if your looking for any company(few) which do ask tough question.(lets say for google, codeforces DIV 2 C and D are recommended, i.e rating up till 1900-2100)


***Clearing Interview:(Relevant links are provided above)

There is no directly path way answer to this.But in general after talking to many seniors and my personal encountering with interviews.The following topics are written in
decreasing priority:1) OOPs > DBMS > OS > CN > System Design
2)SQL Queries
3)Puzzles(have a look at some standard gfg puzzles)
4)Top interview question related to your programming language(say in c++ what is VPTR, virtual function and so on)

Note : 
above priority might vary with company.
And dont worry if you havent done System Design (Its ok, most company dont ask regarding it, if you havent mentioned it in your CV. Still I recommend to do it if time permits).


One more thing of paramount importance is to be prepared for all standard HR questions in prior.
These are the major things. Undeniably you can explore further.


***How to get a call from your dream company.

Great Linkedin contact is undoubtedly required, apart from that make your profile strong by adding various relevant skills which you have or any other accomplishments.
Ill try to expalin its importance with an example, I got directly call for an interview from amazon for FT SDE role at hyd in my 3rd year(but since I was looking for intern, I didnt go). Various company uses linkedin to automate their search and find the one who fits the best for their role.(So have a good linkedin profile)

Now coming to how I got a call from google for interview. 
Answer is linkein.Try to get great contact and be active on linedin.
Undoubtedly you need to have strong profile which fits their need. There was a recruiter who did post that we are looking for different roles at google,so I
did send him my resume. He said ok, apply through the portal(he gave me some link saying I had reffered you, please do apply for your intrested profile.
But later I came to know that it was for FT role not intern.But still was a good learning experience )




**At Last

At last dont lose hope if your unable to come in for interviews because of OT.(Just try above things)
Or say if you are unable to clear HR or technical interviews, just take a pause and see why didnt you?(maybe you might have not brushed up your concepts with OOPs,DBMS,etc)
and keep learning from the interviews you gave.

Just to spirit up you guys, I would like to share my example. I got rejected in :
Oracle Server Tech(was kept on hold, later got an offer)
Qualcomm, Mastercard, Deutsche Bank, Analog Devices(Sw profile),Avalara, ServiceNow.
Then after 7 rejections I was able make for Oracle Financial service Hr round.That HR might have contacted previous Oracle to which I was kept on hold, and got an offer
from there.

I said all this , because I know how difficult it is to handle rejection from a company. 
So keep going friends :)
And please feel free to pull a request, if you feel like adding things to it.
